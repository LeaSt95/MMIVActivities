The seminar talks of Mohn Medical Imaging and Visualization center are organized by a committee composed of graduate student, PhD students and post-docs. The format of the seminars is that of an open forum for 3 to 4 talks per day of 15 mins each about work in progress research topics across all of the MMIV projects. Each seminar day combines research of all projects at MMIV and each talk ends with a short discussion and feedback for the presented work. The seminar day concludes with a social get-together at MMIV with waffles and coffee.

Especially the more informal format of the seminar invite lively discussions that bridge the projects and presenters usually leave with many helpful suggestions for future research and potential collaborations. The multi-project format of the seminars provide a valuable revenue to foster inter-group relationships at MMIV.

This talk was presented by Luca Porta Mana. He is a researcher at the MMIV-ML group. He has a background in physics and probability theory. In his talk, he gave a summary of the recent official statements by the American Statistical Association about the use of p-values and regarding the notion of statistical significance. Simple examples will be given of their properties and usage.

\paragraph*{Dynamic switching between intrinsic and extrinsic mode networks as demands change from passive to active processing}

This talk was presented by Frank Riemer, who is an MRI Physicist working in the Advanced Neuroimaging Project at MMIV. In his presentation, he talked about a study where they report on the relationship between default and extrinsic mode networks across alternating brief periods of rest and active task processing. The work suggest the existence of two large-scale networks, an extrinsic mode network and an intrinsic mode network, which are up- and down-regulated as environmental demands change from active to passive processing.

\paragraph*{Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) Possible mechanisms of action}

This talk was presented by Ute Kessler. Ute is a psychiatrist treating depressive patients here at the Haukeland University Hospital. She is working with Leif Oltedal in the ECT project to understand depression and the mechanisms of ECT.
She writes: ``Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a last resort treatment for severely depressed patients. The treatment offers improvement of psychiatry symptoms when all other treatment options have been exhausted. Considering the challenges, it has a good success rate. We do however not understand how this treatment works. Imaging is used to identify possible biomarkers of improvement and Ute will talk about what may be driving these changes.''
