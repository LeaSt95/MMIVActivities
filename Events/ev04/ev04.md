The seminar talks of Mohn Medical Imaging and Visualization center are organized by a committee composed of graduate student, PhD students and post-docs. The format of the seminars is that of an open forum for 4 talks per day of 20min each about work in progress research topics across all of the MMIV projects. Each seminar day combines research of all projects at MMIV and each talk ends with a short discussion and feedback for the presented work. The seminar day concludes with a social get-together at MMIV with waffles and coffee.

Especially the more informal format of the seminar invite lively discussions that bridge the projects and presenters usually leave with many helpful suggestions for future research and potential collaborations. The multi-project format of the seminars provide a valuable revenue to foster inter-group relationships at MMIV.

This talk entitled "Imaging of preclinical gynecologic cancer models" was presented by Heidi Espedal. She is a post-doctoral fellow working at the molecular imaging center (MIC) of Haukeland University Hospital. She writes "Endometrial cancer is the most common type of cancer of the female reproductive tract. Although prognosis is generally good for patients with low-grade and early-stage diseases, the outcomes for high-grade and metastatic/recurrent cases remain poor, since traditional therapy have limited effects. No targeted agents have been approved so far, although several new drugs have been tested without striking results in clinical trials. Patient-derived tumor xenograft (PDX) mouse models represent useful tools for preclinical evaluation of new therapies and biomarker identification. Preclinical imaging by PET-CT and MRI during disease progression enables visualization and quantification of functional tumor characteristics, which may serve as imaging biomarkers guiding targeted therapies. The primary objective for this presentation is to give an introduction of current and novel preclinical imaging methods relevant for endometrial cancer mouse models."

This talk entitled "The Vitruvian Baby: Interactive reformation of 3D ultrasound data to a T-pose was presented by Eric M\"orth, who is a PhD candidate in multi-modal medical visualization. He writes "Three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound imaging and visualization is often used in medical diagnostics, especially in prenatal screening. Screening the development of the fetus is important to assess possible complications early on. Performing the analysis in a 3D view would enable the viewer to better discriminate between artefacts and representative information. Additionally making data comparable between different investigations and patients is a goal in medical imaging techniques and is often achieved by standardization. 
"The Vitruvian Baby" incorporates a complete pipeline for standardized measuring in fetal 3D ultrasound. The input of the method is a 3D ultrasound screening of a fetus and the output is the fetus in a standardized T-pose. In this pose, taking measurements is easier and comparison of different fetuses is possible. In addition to the transformation of the 3D ultrasound data, we create an abstract representation of the fetus based on accurate measurements."

\paragraph*{The Brain Imaging Data of the ABCD Study}

This talk entitled "The Brain Imaging Data of the ABCD Study – an Introduction into Protocols and Tasks" was presented by Hauke Bartsch of the MMIV. The ABCD study is recruiting and following the brain development and health of over 10,000 $9$-$10$ year olds through adolescence. The imaging component of the study was developed by the ABCD Data Analysis and Informatics Center (DAIC) and the ABCD Imaging Acquisition Workgroup. Imaging methods and assessments were selected, optimized and harmonized across all 21 sites to measure brain structure and function relevant to adolescent development and addiction. This article provides an overview of the imaging procedures of the ABCD study, the basis for their selection and preliminary quality assurance and results that provide evidence for the feasibility and age-appropriateness of procedures and generalizability of findings to the existent literature.

Hauke writes: "
The Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study is the largest long-term study of brain development and child health in the United States. The ABCD Research Consortium have invited 11,878 children ages 9-10 to join the study. Researchers will track their biological and behavioral development through adolescence into young adulthood. 
Using cutting-edge technology, scientists will determine how childhood experiences (such as sports, video-games, social media, unhealthy sleep patterns, and smoking) interact with each other and with a child’s changing biology to affect brain development and social, behavioral, academic, health, and other outcomes. 
As part of a research agreement, MMIV will obtain access to the raw data that includes an extensive MRI protocol as well as behavioral and environmental data."

\paragraph*{Artificial intelligence in image diagnostics}

This talk entitled "Artificial intelligence in image diagnostics – transfer learning and active learning for efficient use of data and radiologist’s expertise" was presented by Sathiesh Kaliyugarasan of MMIV. Sathiesh is a PhD candidate at the MMIV. 
He writes: "A common stumbling block for supervised learning methods based on deep neural networks is the large number of labeled examples required for training. This is particularly troublesome when trying to use deep learning methods for segmentation in 3D medical image data.
As creating labeled data for medical images is often a time-consuming, difficult and unreliable process, the amount of training data available is in general very small. To mitigate this problem we are looking into using design methodologies such as transfer learning and active learning for efficient use of data and radiologist’s expertise."
