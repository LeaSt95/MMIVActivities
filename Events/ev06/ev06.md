No prior git experience is required and everyone is welcome to this class. We start with talking about modern documentation systems for all kinds of textual information and follow up with online demonstrations of the essentials. The workflows we cover include use cases where different computers are used by the same person and workflows where many people work collaboratively across continents.

This workshop is done together with the bio-statistics group of Helse Bergen and we welcome all to take part in this MMIV activity.
