The seminar talks of Mohn Medical Imaging and Visualization center are organized by a committee composed of graduate student, PhD students and post-docs. The format of the seminars is that of an open forum for 4 talks per day of 20min each about work in progress research topics across all of the MMIV projects. Each seminar day combines research of all projects at MMIV and each talk ends with a short discussion and feedback for the presented work. The seminar day concludes with a social get-together at MMIV with waffles and coffee.

Especially the more informal format of the seminar invite lively discussions that bridge the projects and presenters usually leave with many helpful suggestions for future research and potential collaborations. The multi-project format of the seminars provide a valuable revenue to foster inter-group relationships at MMIV.

This talk entitled "Firefly: Virtual Illumination Drones for Interactive Visualization" was presented by Sergej Stoppel. He is a post-doctoral fellow in the Visualization Group at the University of Bergen. He writes "My current research interest is focused on the field of visual data science. By analyzing the intrinsic dimensionality of the data, I work on finding a suitable visual embedding for the data and thus create visualization methods tailored to specifically for the data. Additionally I am interested in high dimensional parameter space exploration and intuitive interaction techniques that support users with complex tasks, by predicting the users intention and providing appropriate support. My latest research projects focused on automatic and time efficient determination of parameter settings for larger algorithmic systems, by exploiting parallel computing and evaluating the parameter space."

This talk entitled "MRI-assessed Tumor-free Distance to Serosa Predicts Deep Myometrial Invasion and Poor Prognosis in Endometrial Cancer" was presented by Julie Dybvik, who is a PhD candidate in gynecological cancer imaging. She writes "The diagnostic accuracy of preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and MRI-based tumor measurements is important for prediction of pathological deep ($\geq$50%) myometrial invasion (pDMI) and for prognostication in endometrial carcinomas (EC). We have investigated preoperative pelvic MRI scans of 357 prospectively included patients with histologically confirmed EC. Three radiologists have reported findings suggesting deep ($\geq$50%) myometrial invasion (iDMI) and the tumor measurements:  axial anteroposterior tumor diameter (APD), depth of myometrial tumor invasion (DOI) and tumor free distance to serosa (TFD). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for prediction of pDMI using hysterectomy specimen as reference standard, were plotted for the different tumor measurements and optimal cut-off values were determined. The predictive and prognostic value of the tumor measurements were analyzed and interobserver agreement was assessed. TFD yielded the highest area under the ROC-curve (AUC) for prediction of pDMI. Multivariate analysis (including cut-off based imaging variables and preoperative histological risk-status) for predicting pDMI yielded highest predictive value of TFD<6 mm with OR of 6.1 (p<0.001) and lower figures for DOI ≥5mm (OR=2.2; p=0.04), APD $\geq$17mm (OR=3.1, p<0.001) and iDMI (OR=1.1 (p=0.76). Patients with TFD<6 mm also had significantly reduced survival with hazard ratio of 1.9; p=0.01. The interobserver agreement was good for APD$\geq$17mm (κ=0.70), moderate for TFD<6 mm (κ=0.52), but only fair for DOI $\geq$5mm  (κ=0.25) and iDMI (κ=0.36).  At preoperative MRI TFD<6 mm was the strongest predictor of pDMI and was associated with poor survival. TFD<6 mm outperforms iDMI for prediction of pDMI and could aid in identifying high-risk disease in endometrial carcinomas. "

\paragraph*{Quantitative analysis of 3D MR images}

This talk entitled "Quantitative analysis of 3D MR images" was presented by Marek Kocinski, a postdoctoral fellow in machine learning at the MMIV. He writes "An accurate modeling of blood-vessel structures depicted in 3D raster images is a crucial issue in vascular disease diagnosis and treatment. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) includes several modalities allowing one to acquire 3D raster images in which blood vessels are visualized e.g. ToF, SWI, QSM. Using the image information about vasculature offers a possibility to create an accurate and comprehensive 3D geometrical model of arteries and veins for each individual patient with personalized geometry and structure of thick blood vessels. As vessel radius splits from thicker down to thinner, with range from centimeters to micrometers at capillary level, for different vessel thickness groups one should apply various quantitative algorithms. One should apply various quantitative algorithms: a 3D geometric model, texture analysis, and DCE-derived blood pharmacokinetics maps for respectively thick, medium and capillary blood vessels."

\paragraph*{One box to fit them all: Diffusion microstructure imaging and the question of where to find water}

This talk entitled "Artificial intelligence in image diagnostics – transfer learning and active learning for efficient use of data and radiologist’s expertise" was presented. Dr Frank Riemer gave an introduction into microstructure diffusion imaging, what other methods exist and how that relates to the underlying acquired data. By making analogies and comparisons to general photography, the talk was designed to be accessible to a wider audience. Preliminary results of on-going research projects in diffusion imaging of Multiple Sclerosis here at Haukeland Hospital were given at the end.
