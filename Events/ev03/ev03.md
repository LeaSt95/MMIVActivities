The seminar talks of Mohn Medical Imaging and Visualization center are organized by a committee composed of graduate student, PhD students and post-docs. The format of the seminars is that of an open forum for 3 to 4 talks per day of 15 mins each about work in progress research topics across all of the MMIV projects. Each seminar day combines research of all projects at MMIV and each talk ends with a short discussion and feedback for the presented work. The seminar day concludes with a social get-together at MMIV with waffles and coffee.

Especially the more informal format of the seminar invite lively discussions that bridge the projects and presenters usually leave with many helpful suggestions for future research and potential collaborations. The multi-project format of the seminars provide a valuable revenue to foster inter-group relationships at MMIV.

This talk was presented by Stian Soltvedt, who is a master's student at the University of Bergen, writing a thesis surveying surgeons and examining the accuracy of different methods of vascular visualization for pre-operative planning.
Stian presented `The Open Anatomy Explorer', a web-based viewer for studying anatomy. It is based on real 3D-surface scanned human anatomy, and provides tools to label regions of the models in a live 3D view that students can freely interact with. He developed the tool to serve as an online resource to learn about the anatomical structure of the body, on an educational platform available to anyone with a modern web browser.


\paragraph*{A data based inquiry into brain-gut axis}

This talk was presented by Noman Haleem. He is a new Marie Curie Research Fellow at the Department of Medicine, Haukeland University Hospital, where his research focuses on the intricate human brain-gut axis. In his talk, he provided an overview of complex brain-gut axis and how he with his team at Haukeland hospital are planning to address this highly potent scientific research problem by leveraging the enormous power of data.
