The seminar talks of Mohn Medical Imaging and Visualization center are organized by a committee composed of graduate student, PhD students and post-docs. The format of the seminars is that of an open forum for 4 talks per day of 20min each about work in progress research topics across all of the MMIV projects. Each seminar day combines research of all projects at MMIV and each talk ends with a short discussion and feedback for the presented work. The seminar day concludes with a social get-together at MMIV with waffles and coffee.

Especially the more informal format of the seminar invite lively discussions that bridge the projects and presenters usually leave with many helpful suggestions for future research and potential collaborations. The multi-project format of the seminars provide a valuable revenue to foster inter-group relationships at MMIV.

This talk was presented by Noeska Smit, Associate Professor at the Department of Informationcs at the University of Bergen, and senior researcher at the MMIV. She writes: "Interaction techniques for temporal data are often focused on affecting the spatial aspects of the data, for instance through the use of transfer functions, camera navigation, or clipping planes. However, the temporal aspect of the data interaction is often neglected. The temporal component is either visualized as individual time steps, an animation, or a static summary over the temporal domain. We propose a novel technique that allows users to interactively specify areas of interest in the spatio-temporal domain. By employing a time-warp function, we are able to slow down time, freeze time, or even travel back in time, around spatio-temporal events of interest. The combination of such a (pre-defined) time-warp function and brushing directly in the data to select regions of interest allows for a detailed review of temporally and spatially localized events, while maintaining an overview of the global spatio-temporal data. In this talk, I will demonstrate an application of this technique to functional MRI (fMRI) data in particular."

This talk was presented by Njål Lura, MD and PhD candidate at the MMIV.
He introduced his talk with: "Uterine cervical cancer represents a major threat to female health worldwide; it is the fourth most common female cancer and one of the leading causes of cancer-related death in low-income countries. Important limitations in cervical cancer treatment are due to: 1) insufficient diagnostic tools with which to identify high-risk disease and 2) insufficient diagnostic tools with which to guide more individualized treatment. This project aims to address these limitations by focusing on the value of preoperative advanced imaging to provide functional and morphological tumor characteristics relevant for treatment and prognosis in uterine cervical cancer."

This talk was presented by Saruar Alam, PhD candidate at the MMIV. He introduced his talk with: "Alzheimer’s disease (AD) can be distinguished using the features obtained from Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and a supervised classifier. Multi-atlas-based-likelihood fusion (MALF) algorithms extract the volumes features of subcortical regions of interest (ROI). The correlation among these ROI features from different brain regions may provide additional valuable information. Subsequently, these ROI-correlative features may affect the classification performance of a supervised classifier. We have classified AD and Mild Cognitive Impairment from cognitively normal subjects using these features and a Support Vector Machine classifier. This article investigates the difference in classification performance between the ROI and ROI-correlative features. Our work also reports the ranks of ROI and ROI-correlative regions. We have observed marginal differences in classification performance and ranking of the most effective regions."

This talk was presented by Rune Eikeland, Senior Research Technician
at the MMIV. 
He introduced his talk with: "The Human Connectome Project (HCP) is a five-year project sponsored by sixteen components of the National Institutes of Health, split between two consortia of research institutions. The project was launched in July 2009 as the first of three Grand Challenges of the NIH's Blueprint for Neuroscience Research. The goal of the Human Connectome Project is to build a "network map" (connectome) that will shed light on the anatomical and functional connectivity within the healthy human brain, as well as to produce a body of data that will facilitate research into brain disorders such as dyslexia, autism, Alzheimer’s disease, and schizophrenia.
The data, processing and visualization tools are freely available for the HCP and I will present them in this talk with an in-depth focus on EPI data pre-processing to reduce susceptibility and motion artefacts with FSL’s eddy tool (https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/eddy)."
