MMIV is organized as a unit within the Department of Radiology at HUS. Since March 2019 MMIV has been localized on the top floor of the new Haraldsplass building with spacious office facilities including 15 offices and additional meeting-/lunch rooms and mingling area.

The primary investigators (PIs) and researchers at MMIV hold their main positions at HUS, UiB, HVL or Norwegian Research Center (Norce), and some of the PIs also hold adjunct professorships/research positions at UiB/HUS.

HUS has PIs/researchers from Dep. of Radiology and Womens Clinic, and many collaborating partners at other hospital departments. The UiB has PIs/MMIV affiliated researchers from Faculty of Medicine (Depts. of Clinical Medicine, Clinical Science and Biomedicine), Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences (Depts. of Informatics and Mathematics) and Faculty of Psychology (Dep. of Biological and Medical Psychology). HVL (Faculty of Engineering and Science) and NORCE (Dep. of Technology) are also represented with PIs.

The leadership group comprising principal investigators of the teams meet monthly to discuss scientific and administrative issues and share updates on progress and plans for the different projects. A monthly public MMIV seminar (duration 60 minutes) followed by coffee/waffles is hosted at Haraldplass in conjuncture with this leadership meeting. The daily management group at MMIV (comprising the Head of MMIV, Ingfrid Haldorsen, senior researcher Hauke Bartsch, associate professor Noeska Smit and Elin Myhrvold [secretary]) have weekly meetings.

Guiding the scientific direction of MMIV, a scientific advisory board (SAB) has been appointed (page 53).

They comprise highly acknowledged international scientists who push the limits of imaging sciences to transform medicine, and we are very enthusiastic to capitalize on close interaction with the SAB in the years to come.
