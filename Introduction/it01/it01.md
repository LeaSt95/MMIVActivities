Mohn Medical Imaging and Visualization center (MMIV) was established in 2017 due to generous financial support from the Trond Mohn Foundation (TMF) coupled by human and financial support by Haukeland University Hospital (HUS) and the University of Bergen (UiB). These institutions shared the ambitious vision: To establish a center for imaging- and visualization research in Bergen. MMIV has since then facilitated high-impact research capitalizing on the advanced preclinical- and clinical imaging infrastructure available at Haukeland/UiB. The center fosters close cooperation across institutions, faculties and departments boosting interdisciplinary research collaboration that yields novel insight relevant for patient care.  

MMIV has already grown to become a strong interdisciplinary research center hosting >40 dedicated scientists. Since 2019 MMIV has been co-localized in the new HUS premises on the top floor of the Haraldsplass building in Ulriksdalen, providing and excellent view of Bergensdalen. More importantly, the center comprises a vibrant hub for the exchange of ideas and expertise among researchers that all work on projects that prosper within MMIV. 

MMIV is a part of the Department of Radiology at Haukeland University Hospital, and we are very happy to be located within the hospital – close to the patients and the factors that impact patient care: \textit{precise diagnosis and staging, accurate prognostication}, and the \textit{development of tailored and targeted treatment strategies}. The support from CEO Eivind Hansen, HUS and the Head of Dep. of Radiology Aslak Aslaksen, HUS has been instrumental for the successful organization of MMIV within HUS. Furthermore, we highly appreciate the support from UiB and Western Norway University of Applied Sciences (HVL) and their researchers working at MMIV, who represent cornerstones of the center. Importantly, the collaborative and mutually supportive attitudes displayed from all involved institutions is central for the success of the center!  

One highlight in 2020 was the MMIV conference in hybrid format entitled: \textbf{"Enabling imaging technology to transform patient care"}. The conference had 50 participants at Bikuben and >200 virtual attendees, with an excellent technical setup ensuring the success of the hybrid format. The title of the conference captures one of the missions of MMIV: \textbf{By capitalizing on the multidisciplinary expertise within the center, we strive to merge efforts with clinical doctors in their endeavors to transform patient care}. The conference featured world-leading experts in machine learning and advanced imaging technologies as well as clinical experts highlighting the clinical relevance and potential impact of these novel methods for patient care.  

Another highlight in 2020 was the inauguration of \textbf{PRESIMAL – a National Network for Precision Imaging and Machine Learning} funded by \textit{Nasjonal samarbeidsgruppe for helseforskning i spesialisthelsetjenesten (NSG)}. \textbf{MMIV} is the coordinator of PRESIMAL and Associate Professor Eli Eikefjord has been recruited as network coordinator; she is also a part of the leadership team at MMIV. 

As the Head of MMIV, it is my true privilege to introduce you to this report, showcasing some of the highlights and successful achievements at MMIV in recent years. Furthermore, I am confident that we are on the right track pursuing more scientific success at MMIV also in the years to come. Most importantly, we will continue to motivate researchers locally and nationally to scrutinize and search for small pieces in the greater puzzle that may transform patient care - a mission really worth striving for!

MMIV research is primarily related to six thematic areas with dedicated teams working closely together on projects related to:
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item Machine learning (Page 14)
%\ref{proj01})  
%\item Research- PACS and infrastructure (Page 16)
%Section~\ref{proj02}) 
%\item Cancer imaging (Page 18)
%Section~\ref{proj03}) 
%\item Neuroimaging (Page 20 and Page 22)
%Sections~\ref{proj04} and ~\ref{proj05}) 
%\item Advanced visualization (Page 24 and Page 26)
%Sections~\ref{proj06} and ~\ref{proj07}) 
%\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Machine learning 
\item Cancer imaging (focus on gynecologic cancer)
\item Neuroimaging (focus on fMRI and psychiatric disorders)
\item Advanced visualization
\item Research-PACS and workflow integrated machine learning 
\item PRESIMAL – National Network for Precision Imaging and Machine Learning  
\end{enumerate}


The leadership group comprising principal investigators in these thematic areas meets monthly to discuss scientific and administrative issues and share updates on progress and plans for projects. A monthly public MMIV seminar (duration 60 minutes) followed by coffee/waffles is hosted at MMIV in conjuncture with this leadership meeting. The daily management group at MMIV consisting of Ingfrid Haldorsen, Hauke Bartsch, Noeska Smit, Alexander S. Lundervold, Eli Eikefjord and Elin Myhrvold [secretary] shares the daily management tasks at MMIV/PRESIMAL through  weekly meetings.
