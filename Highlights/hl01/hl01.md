\subsection*{MMIV retreat at Solstrand Hotel}
To kick off the opening of the new location at Haraldsplass for the MMIV centre, we organized a retreat at the Solstrand hotel in order to get to know each other and further develop plans for the future of the centre. In the two-day meeting in March, every centre member gave a short presentation introducing themselves and their research activities. In addition to the scientific program, the social program enabled everyone to get to know their colleagues in the now co-located centre.

The second annual MMIV Conference entitled "Convergence of medical data science for improved patient care" was held at Bikuben, Haukeland University Hospital. Over 150 participants listened to inspirational talks by both local as well as international speakers on topics related to core research activities at the MMIV.


\subsection*{Helse Vest funding to MMIV initiatives}
Helse-Vest has allocated funds to 61 of the total 285 applications submitted by the deadline of September 15. Njål Lura, PhD candidate in the gynecological cancer imaging project, has received PhD funding from this competitive call. In addition, Satheshkumar (Sathiesh) Kaliyugarasan has received PhD funding for his project in machine learning.

Cecilie Brekke Rygh was awarded financial support for her project "Imaging biomarkers for precision medicine in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)", in which Noeska Smit and Alexander Lundervold co-lead a workpackage on image data analyses and visualization. 

\subsection*{Honorary Membership of the Norwegian Radiological Society}
Ingfrid Haldorsen was awarded honorary membership of the Norwegian Radiologica Society at this year’s Radiologisk Høstmøte in October. She presented a talk entitled 'Why research as a young radiologist?' at the meeting.

\subsection*{Prize for Best Teacher at the Faculty of Medicine}
Arvid Lundervold was awarded the prize for Best Teacher at the Faculty of Medicine by the University of Bergen. In his courses BMED360 and ELMED219, he uses e-learning tools extensively to introduce his students to the course material, and granting them access to big data used for in the teaching. 

\subsection*{The Fulbright Norway Research Prize 2019}
Leif Oltedal was awarded price for the best Fulbright Article of the Year: «Volume of the Human Hippocampus and Clinical Response Following Electroconvulsive Therapy» which was published in Biological Psychiatry i 2018 \href{https://fulbright.no/alumni/alumni-association-in-norway/alumni-prize/fulbrights-artikkelpris-2019-gar-til-leif-oltedal/}{paper}.


\subsection*{Best Article in Abdominal Radiology in 2018}
The Norwegian Radiological Society has awarded Sigmund Ytre-Hauge with the best article in abdominal radiology in 2018 prize for his work "Preoperative Tumor Texture Analysis on MRI Predicts High-Risk Disease and Reduced Survival in Endometrial Cancer" published in the Journal of Magnetic Resonance Imaging. The article is part of Ytre-Hauge's thesis "Advanced imaging biomarkers in endometrial cancer", which he defended in 2019.

In the "Forsking i front" session from 11:30-12:00, Kristine Eldevik Fasmer presented a talk entitled "Kan vi lære maskiner å finne kreft i MR-bilder?". Kristine, who is a PhD student in the cancer imaging project, talks about her work on machine learning for cancer detection in MRI images. The machine learning project had a stand in the exhibition area, also. Here, they showcased a live demo of human action recognition using deep learning, and displayed how deep neural networks can be used to process and produce useful predictions based on medical images.

At Eurographics 2019, the 40th annual Conference of the European Association for Computer Graphics hosted in Genoa Italy, Noeska Smit and Stefan Bruckner were awarded with a Dirk Bartz Prize for Visual Computing in Medicine 2019 (Eurographics Medical Prize). They received this prestigious award for their work on model-based visualization for medical education and training with a team of researchers from the Netherlands and Germany.

Our poster on MRS visualization research entitled "A Visual Encoding System for Comparative Exploration of Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy Data" by Laura Garrison, Jakub Vasicek, Renate Grüner, Noeska Smit, and Stefan Bruckner was awarded the Best Poster at the EuroVis 2019 Conference in Porto, Portugal.


\subsection*{MMIV and COVID-19}
The COVID-19 outbreak at the beginning of 2020 allowed researchers of MMIV to focus on research efforts of disease prevention and characterization of patient data affected by the outbreak. The MMIV clinical response team created tools and procedures to manage the data capture of COVID-19 cases for image and assessment instruments. This included simple measures such as adjusting the radiology workflow at MMIV to allow all radiologists working at MMIV to occupy separate offices, limiting the potential effects of an outbreak. All MMIV seminars switched to a virtual solution.

\subsection*{MMIV researchers awarded NOK 7m from NRC}
In 2020 we received new funding for a project on workflow-related machine learning from the Norwegian Research Council. The project is headed by Hauke Bartsch, Alexander Lundervold, Ingfrid Haldorsen, Arvid Lundervold, Erlend Hodneland, and Erling Andersen. The primary objective of this project is to construct a robust, working prototype that receive a DICOM study pushed from the PACS system, setup and run it through deep learning-based image processing methods, and format and return the resulting information, segmentation mask, derived reports, and quantitative measures back into the PACS. The system will also facilitate the evaluation and further training of the deep learning model based on feedback from the user by storing such modifications as annotations in the PACS. The prototype workflow will be assessed by experienced radiologists from the relevant clinical domains. Secondary objective is to prove that our approach is generalizable. This objective is three-fold: the approach should generalize to other computational medical imaging methods, different medical applications, and provide a clear path to embed our product in production-level, widely used PACS and image reading systems.


\subsection*{Best Poster Prize}
Best poster prize was awarded to MMIV postdoc Havjin Jacob at the CCBIO Conference at Solstrand May, 2019 for the poster entitled: "Radiogenomic signature in endometrial cancer predicts aggressive disease".
