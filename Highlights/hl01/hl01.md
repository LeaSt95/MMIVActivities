The third annual MMIV Conference entitled "Enabling imaging technology to transform patient care" was held at Bikuben, Haukeland University Hospital and online. Over 50 participants locally and many more online listened to inspirational talks by both local as well as international speakers on topics related to core research activities at the MMIV.


\subsection*{Helse Vest funding to MMIV initiatives in 2020}
Helse-Vest have allocated funds to 54 of the total 276 applications submitted by the deadline of September 15. Leif Oltedal has received project support for his project "Disrupt, potentiate and rewire – a novel framework for understanding electroconvulsive therapy". In addition, Kari Strøno Wagner-Larsen, PhD candidate in the gynecological cancer imaging project, has received PhD funding from this competitive call for her project "Advanced MRI for developing more personalized treatment stategies in uterine cervical cancer".  

Professor Frank Pfeffer was awarded financial support for his project "Relevance of liquid biopsies and surgery for improving survival of proximal colon cancer", in which Ingfrid Haldorsen and Noeska Smit are project partners. Furthermore, professor Camilla Krakstad was awarded support for her project "Clinical implementation of imaging and molecular markers for Endometrial Carcinoma" in which Ingfrid Haldorsen is partner.

The presentation of the paper "ParaGlyder: Probe-driven Interactive Visual Analysis for Multiparametric Medical Imaging Data" authored by Eric Mörth, Ingfrid S. Haldorsen, Stefan Bruckner and Noeska N. Smit, was awarded with the CGI2020 Best Interdisciplinary Presentation Award. 

Eric comments: "Endometrial Cancer is the most common gynecological cancer in industrialized countries. To improve quality of live for the affected patients, researchers of the Mohn Medical Imaging and Visualization Center (MMIV) strive for a personalized treatment for every patient. In order to analyze the multiple medical imaging scans, we developed, together with gynecological tumor radiology experts, machine learning experts and neurological cancer imaging experts, ParaGlyder, a tool for visual analysis of multiparametric imaging data."

\subsection*{Karl-Heinz Höhne Award}

At the Visual Computing in Biology and Medicine (VCBM) fachgruppe meeting in Regensburg, Germany, Laura Garrison was awarded with the Karl-Heinz Höhne Award. Since 2004, the VCBM organization awards excellent contributions in the field of medical and biological visualization. Laura received the award for her contributions to interactive visual exploration of biomedical processes in cohort data.

\subsection*{First Master in Medical Technology}

Ingrid Mossige, who completed her master thesis at MMIV, was the first Master student to be awarded with a degree in Medical Technology at the University of Bergen! She was advised by Leif Oltedal and Renate Grüner. Her master thesis focused on the calculation of doses in electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) taking into account individual differences and ensuring equal treatment effect. 

\subsection*{MMIV and COVID-19}
The COVID-19 outbreak at the beginning of 2020 allowed researchers of MMIV to focus on research efforts of disease prevention and characterization of patient data affected by the outbreak. The MMIV clinical response team created tools and procedures to manage the data capture of COVID-19 cases for image and assessment instruments. This included simple measures such as adjusting the radiology workflow at MMIV to allow all radiologists working at MMIV to occupy separate offices, limiting the potential effects of an outbreak. All MMIV seminars switched to a virtual solution.

Towards the end of 2020, as restrictions started to lift, we organized the MMIV conference in a hybrid format, allowing participants and speakers to participate in person or online, which made our event even more accessible to national and international attendees. We plan to repeat this successful formula for 2021.
