Tania Martínez-Montero held two masters degree in psychology and clinical neuropsychology, and an MSc in Cognitive and Behavioral Neuroscience from the University of Granada, Spain. She was a PhD Candidate at ReState research group project "When Default is not Default", at the University of Bergen. Her project focused on vigilance and arousal fluctuations and how vigilance/arousal fluctuations affects the reliability of brain networks studies. Unfortunately, Tania passed away unexpectedly in 2021. For us at MMIV, Tania and her contributions will never be forgotten.
