After graduating from the Department of Physics at King's College London, Frank Riemer obtained his PhD from University College London (UCL) in Neuroscience. Working at the Institute of Neurology at Queen Square London, he performed the very first human sodium imaging (23Na-MRI) in the UK and translated this method for the application in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) research.
He then spent his formative years as a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Radiology at the University of Cambridge further developing and applying his 23Na-MR imaging techniques for cancer.
He is currently working in the Advanced Neuroimaging project at the MMIV. His research focusses on multiparametric MRI approaches with a focus on multinuclear and diffusion MR.
