\textbf{Research focus:} In this project we aim to bridge artificial intelligence (AI) with the radiography profession to advance MRI practice and patient care. The project will address the effects of patient and MRI acquisition parameter variations when using AI for quantitative image analysis, address reproducibility issues of AI driven quantitative image analysis, and evaluate the integration of AI driven quantitative image analysis in current radiology workflow.  

\noindent
\textbf{Current challenges in the field:} In clinical practice radiographers perform imaging procedures providing medical images that are used to detect and diagnose disease with only limited attempts to quantify what is visualized. Radiologists interpret images based on visual assessment and observer-driven pattern recognition. Despite the new era of quantitative imaging and the proven clinical potential of quantitative imaging biomarkers (QIB), very few QIBs are clinically used. Patient and image variability may have a major impact on the success of integrating image analysis algorithms and the accurate and reliable extraction of clinical useful biomarkers. The next generation radiography practice and research must take more consciously into account the quantitative nature of medical image data, from patient preparation, image acquisition and image analysis. In such way, enhanced diagnostic information will be provided and ensure more efficient image analysis workflows to improve patient care. 

\noindent
\textbf{Project:} The project is designed in four parts with related research questions: 1. What effect do different image related variables have on the success of AI-driven segmentation algorithms in gynaecological MRI? 2. What effect do pre-processing algorithms (image registration and motion correction) have on quantitative imaging biomarkers (tumour volume and apparent diffusion coefficient) reproducibility in gynaecological MRI data? 3. How do different stakeholders evaluate an innovative radiology workflow integrating AI driven quantitative imaging analysis according to user friendliness, accuracy, performance, and feasibility of integration into local workflow? 4. How can digital health innovations, including AI and machine learning, be purposefully integrated into the radiography professions education and clinical practice to enhance patient care?

To ensure usefulness of the proposed research and innovation project it will be applied to endometrial cancer, one of the most common gynaecological carcinomas in western countries.

In the image above, the upper arrow describes the current decision-making process from image acquisition, through the radiologist's interpretation followed by a conclusion that influences the treatment the patients receive. The lower arrow illustrates the steps and improvements we aim to carry out in this project representing the next generation of radiography. A more automated feature extraction pipeline culminating in a push button system will enable more information to be drawn from the image datasets without increasing the radiologist's workload. The blue areas illustrate the radiographerâ€™s role in the current (top) and next generation (bottom) approach. 
 


\noindent
\textbf{Future plans:} the project has recently been launched and no results are currently available. The next-generation image acquisition represents a challenge to the status quo in the radiography profession. Radiography research can aid the translation and integration of AI into radiology workflow by addressing validation and standardization issues, and through innovative methods contribute to design the next generation radiology workflow.
