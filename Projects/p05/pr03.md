This project addresses a very timely and highly important question of cognitive and clinical neuroscience studies: What factors influence the reliability of neuroimaging studies? What are the sources of individual variability? Which constraining factors may help predicting the outcome of a certain therapy?

\noindent
Recent studies have estimated the reproducibility of psychological studies to be 39\% or less and indicated a severe limitation of neuroimaging (fMRI) study reliability. Too small sample sizes, low to moderate effect sizes, and only partly understood neurophysiological mechanisms behind the BOLD/fMRI signal make it difficult to generalize results, thereby impeding the impact of highly needed neuroscience studies on theoretical (scientific), methodological, and clinical progress.

\noindent
The overall objectives of this project are to (i) improve our understanding of the neurophysiological mechanism of the BOLD signal and its sources of variability, to (ii) extend current methods on effective and functional connectivity measures (Connectoms), to (iii) find a solution to the replication crisis by developing new Bayesian, topology-based, and machine-learning based analysis methods as alternative approaches to today’s analysis strategies, and to (iv) induce a paradigm shift from the current focus on an easy to measure but susceptible BOLD signal to the underlying, but (partly) hidden neuronal states that are presumably more stable and reliable.

\noindent
So far, we have analysed data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP), a database of more than 1000 subjects, and data from the BETULA project, a longitudinal study conducted in Umeå (Sweden). We have also recently started to analyse data from other databases, such as the UK biobank. By now, we have focused on the time of day effects. With the help of cross-spectral dynamic causal modelling (csd-DCM) analyses of resting-state fMRI data, we could show for both the HCP and the BETULA database that the fMRI signal varies over the days, while the underlying neuronal activity doesn’t change to the same degree. This indicates that the fMRI signal needs careful interpretations, depending on when the data were collected. This is particularly sensitive if different study groups are (accidentally) collected at different times of day or year. A related analysis showed that blood pressure and body mass can cause between-subject and between-group variability in the BOLD signal and that all the included factors can affect the underlying connectivity. Given the results of the current and previous studies, rs-fMRI results appear to be susceptible to a range of factors, which is likely to contribute to the low degree of replicability of these studies. Interestingly, the highest degree of variability appears within the much-studied Default Mode Network and its connections to other networks.
