The national network PRESIMAL was established in 2020/2021 on behalf of and with the support of Nasjonal samarbeidsgruppe for helseforskning I spesialisthelsetjenesten (NSG).

PRESIMAL brings together several of Norway's leading research environments within precision imaging and machine learning. The network will facilitate research related to machine learning in precision medicine with a special focus on medical imaging, across imaging methods and diseases. The network aims to promote the development of more precise diagnostic imaging methods allowing better prognostication and tailoring of treatment. Through the exchange of imaging data, methods, infrastructure and interdisciplinary expertise in precision imaging, the network will provide a hub for accelerating these endeavors. Furthermore, the network will stimulate the establishment of national digital platforms for testing machine learning algorithms in clinical practice, thus add momentum for translating machine learning algorithms into potential clinical implementation. 

Several network activities will be organized: conferences, workshops, research courses  and organization of competitions. Travel grants for researchers visiting other relevant institutions will be awarded.

PRESIMAL is managed and coordinated by the Mohn Medical Imaging and Visualization Center (MMIV). The network coordinator for PRESIMAL is Associate Professor Eli Eikefjord. She is responsible for coordinating and heading PRESIMAL together with Professor Ingfrid S. Haldorsen, Associate Professor Alexander S. Lundervold, Associate Professor Noeska Smit and Associate Professor Hauke Bartsch at MMIV, Department of Radiology, Haukeland University Hospital in Bergen. The latest news about PRESIMAL can be found on the network's website https://mmiv.no/presimal/ and on the social medias LinkedIn (PRESIMAL) and TWITTER (@PRESIMAL\_) that are coordinated by Karolina Berg who is PRESIMALs SoMe responsible.
