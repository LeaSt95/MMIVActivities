\subsection*{Research focus}
Advances in medical imaging techniques are bringing more and more different contrasts that provide additional information. For instance, a single patient can have a CT scan, PET scan, as well as an MRI scan with different weighted images. When there is more than one modality acquired, mental integration of the different contrasts between the different images becomes more challenging. In this project, we aspire to develop novel interactive visualization approaches for improved exploration, analysis, and communication of multimodal medical imaging data. Our current focus in this context is on multi-parametric MR acquisitions.

\noindent
\subsection*{Current challenges in the field}
Most multimodal medical imaging visualization methods are targetting no more than two modalities at the same time. Our research aims to further improve methods so that a multitude of modalities can be analyzed at once.   

\noindent
\subsection*{Project}
In this project, we are currently focusing on multiple application areas. Eric Mörth is researching novel interactive visualization approaches for the visualization of multimodal MR data in the context of gynecalogical cancer imaging in collaboration with MMIV gynecological cancer imaging researchers and the Bergen Gynecologic Cancer Research Group. Sherin Sugathan researches novel interactive visualization approaches for the visualization of multimodal MR data in the context of MS and ECT in collaboration with the MMIV neuroimaging researchers.

\noindent
\subsection*{Important results}
The developed methods are prototyped in software applications that can be used by researchers within MMIV. One example of this is the application developed by Sugathan for the analysis of multi-parametric MR in the context of MS research.

This application combines multiple interactively linked views to relate MS lesions in 2D and 3D views as well as mapping potential lesion impact via DTI fiber tracking.

\noindent
\subsection*{Future plans}
The team is currently investigating novel tools for visual analysis of multi-modal data across larger cohorts of patients and in time-varying multimodal data analysis.
