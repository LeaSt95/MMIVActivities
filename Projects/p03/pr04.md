\textbf{Research focus:} Gynecologic cancers have characteristic structural and functional imaging features reflected in clinical phenotypes, and these imaging markers highlight pathogenic mechanisms potentially targetable by novel treatments. The focus in this project is to integrate imaging biomarkers into clinically relevant treatment algorithms by identifying molecular targets for treatment based on imaging biomarker profiles.

\textbf{Project:} Imaging- and molecular/tissue biomarkers in gynecologic cancer are studied in patients and in preclinical gynecologic cancer models (see Figure). Potential imaging biomarkers are identified using machine learning algorithms applied to multiparametric and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) from patients and in mouse models during therapy. Furthermore, the molecular and genetic alterations in the same tumors as well as clinical phenotype and survival are studied in relation to the corresponding imaging biomarker profile. This setup provides a unique platform for identifying promising molecular targets for treatment and their corresponding imaging biomarker profiles.

\textbf{Important results/milestones:} Imaging based tumor textural features (radiomic signatures) predict aggressive disease in endometrial cancer.
An AI platform for automated and accurate tumor segmentation in endometrial cancer for extraction of whole-volume radiomic tumor signatures has been developed \textbf{\href{http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-80068-9}{(Hodneland et al, Scientific Reports 2021)}}.
Novel visualization tools for assessment of multidimensional imaging data has been developed \textbf{\href{http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/cgf.14172}{(Mörth et al, Computer Graphics Forum 2020}\href{http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-61864-3_29}{, Advances in Computer Graphics 2020)}}.


\noindent
\textbf{Future plans/work in progress:} 
Extend the AI platforms for automated tumor segmentation to other tumor types such as cervical cancer for extraction of whole-volume radiomic tumor signatures (in collaboration with Machine Learning Group/A. Lundervold).

Develop new visualization tools with which to explore and assess multidimensional imaging data in relation to clinical/tissue data in gynecologic cancer (in collaboration with Visualization Group/N. Smit). 

Collect and analyze imaging data (for validation in "external" test sets) from gynecological cancer patients treated at different institutions using Research PACS (in collaboration with Hauke Bartsch).  

Assess the radiogenomic tumor profile linking genetic signature to radiomic signature in gynecologic cancer (in collaboration with Bergen Gynecologic Cancer Research Group/Prof. Camilla Krakstad). 

\noindent
\textbf{Current challenges in the field:} \textbf{Three major clinical challenges} in gynecologic cancers are:  \textbf{(1) Overtreatment} of low-risk patients (with early stage disease) who experience unnecessary surgical and/or radiotherapy-/chemotherapy-induced side effects and thereby \textbf{reduced quality of life}. \textbf{(2) Undertreatment} of patients falsely categorized as low-risk patients who will experience recurrence. \textbf{(3) Poor survival in metastatic disease} with no effective targeted therapy or response marker to conventional systemic therapies. \textbf{The role of imaging markers and radiomic tumor profiling for risk-stratified tailored treatment algorithms and development of targeted therapies is not yet defined.}  


\noindent
\textbf{Focus in the coming years:} 
Explore and exploit the potential of precision imaging to enable more targeted treatment strategies and improved patient care in gynecologic cancer.
