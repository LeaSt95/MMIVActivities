\noindent
\textbf{Research focus:} 
Data science is revolutionizing medicine.  
Rapidly improving medical imaging provides  
steadily growing and increasingly varied insight into medical conditions. 
The increased amount and complexity of imaging data leads to significant challenges in knowledge extraction and decision making. 
To optimally exploit this new wealth of information, it is crucial that the acquired imaging data is successfully linked to the medical condition of the patient.  
Analogous to biomarkers, which are molecular structures that are used to identify medical conditions, imaging biomarkers are information structures in medical images that can help with diagnostics and treatment planning, formulated in terms of features that can be computed from the imaging data. 
Successful imaging biomarker discovery is highly challenging and traditionally only a single hypothesis (for a new biomarker) can be examined at a time.  
This makes it impossible to explore a large number in reasonable time as well as more complex imaging biomarkers across multi-aspect data. 
In the VIDI project, we research and advance visual data science to improve imaging biomarker discovery through the visual integration of multi-aspect medical data with a new visualization-enabled hypothesis management framework.

\textbf{Project goals:} 
We aim at accelerating the discovery of new imaging biomarkers by enabling the study of structured sets of hypotheses through the well-balanced integration of computational approaches and interactive visual exploration. 
We also work on enabling the discovery of more complex imaging biomarkers, across multiple modalities, that potentially are able to more accurately characterize diseases. 
This may lead to a new way of designing innovative and effective imaging protocols and to the discovery of new imaging biomarkers.

\textbf{Important results:} % 
Due to VIDI's interdisciplinary research, we could work out several relevant results, including: 
\par
\textit{Interactive Visual Exploration of Metabolite Ratios in MR Spectroscopy Studies~--}
in the context of our work on MR spectroscopy data visualization, we extended our SpectraMosaic tool to enable the visual analysis of complex metabolic signatures. 
% This work is currently under review for the Computers & Graphics Special Section on Visual Computing in Biology and Medicine. It is based on a previously accepted design study paper, SpectraMosaic, which was presented at and published in the proceedings of the 9th EuroGraphics Workshop on Visual Computing for Biology and Medicine. 
\par
\textit{Interactive Visual Exploration of Clinical Data~--}
in collaboration with colleagues from Magdeburg in Germany, we developed new visual data science methods for hypothesis generation in multi-dimensional, heterogeneous clinical data, including (1) an extension of the dual analysis framework to high-dimensional qualitative data as well as (2) a new method (DimLift) for the interactive hierarchical data exploration through dimensional bundling.   
% This project is ongoing, and so far has produced two papers, both of which are under review in their respective venues. 
\par
\textit{Effects of Motion Correction and Sampling Rate in DCE-MRI data~--}
our study of dynamic contrast enhanced MRI as potential diagnostic tool for Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) suggests the use of a high-level elastic motion correction scheme with a sampling rate of at least 4s.  
\par
\textit{Scan- and Patient-Specific Arterial Input Functions in a Longitudinal DSC-MRI Study~--} working with a large patient cohort, we found that AIFs should be chosen per partient, comparing also automatically and semi-automatically chosen AIFs.  
\par
\textit{Visual Data Science for Diffusion Weighted MR Images~--}
we work on the integration of machine learning (in particular, an autoencoder network) with interactive visual data exploration and analysis to extract information from diffusion weighted MR images that goes beyond linear diffusion tensors.  
%
\par
\noindent
\textbf{Future plans:} % 
Next, we plan to explore causal model validation and research new visual data science methods to support medical decision making.  We also aim to understand whether DSC-MRI can help with detecting early effects of Gamma Knife Surgery on brain metastases.  Further, we study the opportunity of having machine learning can enable a semi-automatic delineation of critical fiber tracks in DWI data.
