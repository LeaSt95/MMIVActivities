Over the past decade there has been a lot of interest in artificial intelligence or AI (loosely: "the theory, development, and application of computer systems able to perform tasks normally requiring human intelligence") across many disciplines and industries, including medicine. This was mainly caused by breakthroughs in what’s called "deep learning", a collection of techniques that enable computers to uncover complicated patterns and connections in large data sets. Increased access to data ("big data") and increased computational power has made so-called \emph{deep neural networks} useful for real-world, practical problems, and they have become the state-of-the-art approach to many key challenges in computer vision, language modelling and robotics.

These developments have a huge potential for medical imaging technology, medical data analysis, medical diagnostics and healthcare in general, slowly being realized [lundervold2019aoo]. That's not only true for deep learning methods, but also for the wider field of machine learning and data analysis, as part of \emph{computational medicine}. There are however many inherent limitations and challenges with this approach to medical data analysis, ranging from technical limitations to issues related to workflow-integration, trust and regulation. 

At the MMIV we work to develop, implement, disseminate and evaluate machine learning techniques in the analysis of medical data, emphasizing analysis of medical images and image-related data.

To successfully incorporate machine learning in medicine, doctors and medical specialists have to take a leading role in both research and development. The tight integration with our project and the hospital, where data is collected and decisions are made, is crucial for our success. 

Since MMIV's inception, we've viewed educational activities as an important component of the center's current and future success. We've therefore created and taken part in a wide range of courses within \textit{Medical AI}, from bachelor's to PhD, targeting students from medicine, life sciences, computer science and engineering. The goal of our investment in teaching and course creation is to recruit the next generation of researchers to the field, and to increase the general level of understanding of the roles computational medicine and machine learning play for the future of medical imaging in particular and the future of medicine in general. Two courses that have been especially important in our view are:

\begin{itemize}
\item ELMED219: "Artificial intelligence and computational medicine" \href{https://github.com/MMIV-ML/ELMED219-2020}{[Link]}, UiB \& HVL. The course has been given since 2019 as part of the elective period at the medical studies of UiB. It is a collaboration between UiB and HVL and is targeted at medical students and engineers at the MSc level. The course got some publicity during its first run. It was mentioned in the Norwegian government's \emph{"Nasjonal strategi for kunstig intelligens"}, in Teknologir\aa det’s report on \emph{"Artificial Intelligence: Opportunities, Challenges and a Plan for Norway"}, in a hearing at Stortinget on \emph{"Langtidsplan for forskning og h\o yere utdanning 2019-2028"}, at forskning.no and in the Faculty of Medicine newsletter. 
\item DLN-AI: "A hands-on course on artificial intelligence in computational biotechnology and medicine" \href{https://github.com/MMIV-ML/MMIV-DLN-AI-2021}{[Link]}, HVL. The course is part of the Digital Life Norway Research School, and is open for all interested PhD students in Norway.
\end{itemize}
In addition, we've created or been involved in many other courses (BMED360, HELIKT620, ELMED223, RAD840, a PhD course organized by NORBIS, the NordBioMed Summer School, and more).

We also put considerable emphasis on dissemination and discussion of methods and results with a wide audience, as part of public and scientific presentations, participations in committees and boards, and the production of written material aimed at the general public. 


%In addition to research, we also offer interdisciplinary courses for medical students, engineers and natural science students (e.g. open courseware for %"Artificial intelligence and computational medicine" \href{https://github.com/MMIV-ML/ELMED219-2020}{[ELMED219]}, "In vivo imaging and physiological %modelling" \href{https://github.com/computational-medicine/BMED360-2020}{[BMED360]}, and the upcoming "A hands-on introduction to artificial intelligence in %computational biotech and medicine" \href{https://digitallifenorway.org/no/dlnrs/courses/%a-hands-on-introduction-to-artificial-intelligence-in-computational-biotech-and-medicine}{[link]} at the Digital Life Norway Research School), and put %considerable emphasis on dissemination and discussion of methods and results with a wide audience (e.g. \emph{An overview of deep learning in medical imaging %focusing on MRI} \href{https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0939388918301181}{[link ZMP]}).

Our main ambition is to contribute to an increased degree of \emph{personalized medicine} and better decision support for diagnosis, prognosis and therapy in diseases and conditions where images are an important source of information.

The project is part of Centre for Digital Life Norway as an Associated Project. See the Digital Life Norway project \href{https://www.digitallifenorway.org/research/medimml/index.html}{MedImML website} for more.
