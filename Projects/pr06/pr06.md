\textbf{Research focus:} Advances in medical imaging techniques are bringing more and more different contrasts that provide additional information. For instance, a single patient can have a CT scan, PET scan, as well as an MRI scan with different weighted images. When there is more than one modality acquired, mental integration of the different contrasts between the different images becomes more challenging. In this project, we aspire to develop novel interactive visualization approaches for improved exploration, analysis, and communication of multimodal medical imaging data. Our current focus in this context is on multi-parametric MR acquisitions.

\noindent
\textbf{Current challenges in the field:} Most multimodal medical imaging visualization methods are targetting no more than two modalities at the same time. Our research aims to further improve methods so that a multitude of modalities can be analyzed at once.   

\noindent
\textbf{Project:} In this project, we are currently focusing on two application areas. Eric Mörth is researching novel interactive visualization approaches for the visualization of multimodal MR data in the context of gynecalogical cancer imaging in collaboration with the MMIV gynecological cancer imaging project and the Bergen Gynecologic Cancer Research Group. Sherin Sugathan researches novel interactive visualization approaches for the visualization of multimodal MR data in the context of MS in collaboration with the MMIV Advanced Neuroimaging project.

\noindent
\textbf{Important results:} The developed methods are prototyped in software applications that can be used by researchers within MMIV. One example of this is the ParaGlyder application developed by Mörth for the analysis of multi-parametric MR in the context of gynecological cancer imaging.

The ParaGlyder application combines spatial and non-spatial visualization to enable multi-parametric analysis and exploration.

\noindent
\textbf{Future plans:} The team is currently investigating novel tools for visual analysis of multi-modal data across cohorts of patients. In the future, we hope to further investigate time-varying multimodal data analysis.
