\subsection*{Research focus}
\label{proj04}
Understanding treatment mechanisms and predictors of clinical response. 


\subsection*{Current challenges in the field}

Major depression is a common and serious medical condition that may lead to profound suffering for affected individuals and families. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a procedure, done under general anesthesia, in which electric currents are passed through the brain, intentionally causing a brief seizure. Although ECT has remained the most effective acute treatment for major depressive episodes for nearly 80 years, how it works and why it is effective is not well known. Only a small proportion of patients with treatment resistant depression are offered ECT, and typically 60-80\% experience a good response (> 50\% symptom reduction). 

Several neuroimaging studies of ECT have demonstrated volume increases of brain areas after treatment. The most consistent finding has been volume increase of the hippocampus. However, a link between the treatment induced brain changes and clinical improvement has not been established. An important reason for our knowledge gap is that single studies have limited samples and lack statistical power to reach firm conclusions. The Global ECT-MRI Research Collaboration was founded with a belief that collaboration and mega-analysis of combined data will lead to new knowledge that can be generalized across individual research sites.

Patients ask for evidence-based advice – prior to treatment – about their personal risk of side effects as well as the probability of good clinical response. Our research explores how ECT changes the brain, and if the structural (or functional) changes that are seen can explain the effect (or side-effects) of the treatment. A long-term goal is to develop algorithms which can predict clinical outcome. 


\subsection*{Important results}

\subsubsection{Local ECT-MRI study}
Study protocol published in 2015 (PMID: 25927716), data collection (N=40 patients and 2 control groups with N = 20) was completed in ultimo 2018. The data include multimodal imaging, clinical assessments, neuropsychological testing, blood samples. Data are being shared in GEMRIC and with other collaborators, see below for GEMRIC results. A total of 16 papers have been published since the study started; in 2020 important results were published on the neuropsychological effects (PMID: 32408397), on GABA/anticonvulsant effects (PMID: 32940003) and a landmark paper on acute and long-term effects on brain structure (PMID: 34464749).  

\subsubsection{Global GEMRIC study}

A consortium paper was published in 2017 (PMID: 28275543). Our first project investigated the effects of ECT induced volume change of the hippocampus was published in 2018 (PMID: 30006199). In 2019 we documented that the brain changes induced by ECT are broadly distributed in the brain and not specific for the hippocampus (PMID: 31561859), and in a separate analysis we showed that the electrical field of the stimulus is correlated to the volume change (PMID: 31644424). In 2020 and 2021, four more publications have been published from GEMRIC, including the use of machine learning to predict outcome. More than 20 sites have contributed data giving a current potential for > 900 subjects. To increase collaborations, the working groups on cognition and MRI processing have been activated and will report to the board in the autumn GEMRIC meeting.

\subsection*{Future plans}

\subsubsection{New local study} 
Our new local ECT/TMS-MRI study starts inclusion in September 2021
Thanks to a new grant for Helse Vest (2021-23), we are starting a new study where we will compare effects of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) with ECT. The overarching goal of the project is to understand what these brain stimulation techniques does to the brain and why they are effective. Data collection and hypotheses in this new project will be guided by our novel model of mechanisms of action of ECT. In this model, ECT; i) disrupts the current brain state, ii) potentiate the neuroplasticity of brain circuits which ii) allows rewiring of more healthy circuits in the weeks and months following treatment. A paper describing the hypothesis have already been published (PMID: 34274106). Flow chart of the study is shown below.

\subsubsection{Global GEMRIC study} 
Due to the pandemic, GEMRIC-meetings of 2020 and 2021 have so far been virtual 2-hour events. We look forward to being able to see each other again – and will arrange a 3rd Bergen workshop in 2022. GEMRIC have continued to add new data and new sites with a goal of sample size of 2000. So far, five common projects/analyses have been conducted, and more the 20 are ongoing. Through our common effort, we will further document the effects of ECT on the human brain. New studies will also include resting state fMRI and diffusion weighted imaging (e.g. Diffusion Tensor Imaging). Many will use machine learning algorithms – with a goal of predicting effects and- or side effects. We will also motivate new prospective studies and have already develop recommendations for harmonization of such studies.
