Over the past decade breakthroughs in machine learning (ML) has led to a renewed interest in artificial intelligence or AI (loosely: "the theory, development, and application of computer systems able to perform tasks normally requiring human intelligence") across many disciplines and industries. This is caused by breakthroughs in what’s called "deep learning", a collection of techniques that enable computers to uncover complicated patterns and connections in large data sets. Increased access to data ("big data") and increased computational power has made so-called \emph{deep neural networks} useful for real-world, practical problems, and they have become the state-of-the-art approach to many key challenges in computer vision, language modelling and robotics.

These developments have a huge potential for medical imaging technology, medical data analysis, medical diagnostics and healthcare in general, slowly being realized. That's not only true for deep learning methods, but also for the wider field of machine learning and data analysis, as part of \emph{computational medicine}.

Our project will develop, implement, disseminate and evaluate machine learning techniques in the analysis of medical images and image-related data.

To successfully incorporate machine learning in medicine, doctors and medical specialists have to take a leading role in both research and development. Our project, initiated from the Department of Biomedicine at UiB and the Department of Computing, Mathematics and Physics at HVL, is therefore tightly connected with departments at the hospital where data is collected and decisions are made.

It involves many researchers in Bergen, both clinical and methodological, in addition to national and international collaborators from world-class research institutions in the USA (Mayo Clinic, prof. Bradley Erickson), France (ISIMA, prof. Vincent Barra), and Poland (TUL, prof. Andrzej Materka).

In addition to research, we also offer interdisciplinary courses for medical students, engineers and natural science students (e.g. open courseware for "Artificial intelligence and computational medicine" \href{https://github.com/MMIV-ML/ELMED219-2020}{[ELMED219]}, "In vivo imaging and physiological modelling" \href{https://github.com/computational-medicine/BMED360-2020}{[BMED360]}, and the upcoming "A hands-on introduction to artificial intelligence in computational biotech and medicine" \href{https://digitallifenorway.org/no/dlnrs/courses/a-hands-on-introduction-to-artificial-intelligence-in-computational-biotech-and-medicine}{[link]} at the Digital Life Norway Research School), and put considerable emphasis on dissemination and discussion of methods and results with a wide audience (e.g. \emph{An overview of deep learning in medical imaging focusing on MRI} \href{https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0939388918301181}{[link ZMP]}).

Our main ambition is to contribute to an increased degree of \emph{personalized medicine} and better decision support for diagnosis, prognosis and therapy in diseases and conditions where images are an important source of information.

The project is part of Centre for Digital Life Norway as an Associated Project. See the Digital Life Norway project \href{https://digitallifenorway.org/prosjekter/medimml-computational-medical-imaging-and-machine-learning}{MedImML website} for more.
