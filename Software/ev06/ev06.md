\lettrine[lines=4]{\color{Black}T}{} his repository provides access to programs developed at MMIV for the detection of brain lesions.

After detecting lesions in-painting can be used to synthetically create a version of the raw data were lesions are masked with assumed intensity values similar to the neighboring voxel in the data. Such synthetic data can be used for algorithms that are sensitive to the lesions otherwise - such as FreeSurfer.

The provided algorithm performs a region growing of initially 2 voxel to create a lesion border. This border might be affected by partial volume effect. Afterwards another 2 voxel morphological grow operation defines a region of background voxel used for the interpolation of the lesion and the lesion border voxel intensities.

For lesions that are close to the border of white matter the interpolation might not be correct as it would blurr intensities from different tissue types across the lesion volume. Instead it might be more appropriate to limit the intensities for interpolation to the voxel of a single material. For these pusposes you can provide an additional mask argument - limiting the sample points for the interpolation to the white matter material only.

In order to quantify the location of a lesion relative to the cortical surface an approach can be used that calculates curvilinear (geodesic) distances between two labels, the ventricles located in the center of the brain and the cortical gray to white matter surface. This approach mimics the general direction of the path neurons travel during cortex development.

Please visit the https://github.com/mmiv-center/HeatEquation project that implements such a method.
